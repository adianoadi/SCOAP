# SCOAP
 SCOAP (Sequential Controllability/Observability Analysis Package) is a testability analysis method for digital circuits. It was developed by Goldstein and colleagues in 1982. The SCOAP measures are used to identify signals that are difficult to control or observe, which can help in the design of test patterns to detect faults in the circuit.
